  <p style="margin-top:40px;">Antioxidant activity of the tea catechin is onebjects which is widely studied among these bioactivities of the tea.
  And cal scavenging activity of r antioxidant-rich foods, it was reported that green tea was scoredblack tea and lower than red wine, and was ranked on the top ten of fifty foods.
  In addition, among the four main tea catechins, gallated catechins such as EGC adical scavenging activity than non-gallated catechins such as EGC and EC on both ABTS and DPPH assays.</p>
